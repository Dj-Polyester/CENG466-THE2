Second Take home exam of the course CENG466 - Fundamentals of Image Processing. Fourier transform of some well known image filters are implemented.
Numpy is used for the implementation of Fourier transform (`FT`) and OpenCV library is used for working with images and other workloads.
The assignment is given in the pdf file. Different filters are tried with different variations that use hard and Gaussian weighting.
